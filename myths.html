                <p>Some people assume that samurai warriors were a small, elite fighting force of Japan's army,
                    but this couldn't be further from the truth. According to Encyclopedia Britannica, they accounted
                    for roughly 10% of the region's entire population during the Tokugawa period (1603 to 1867).</p>

                <p>Just because they were adept at fighting doesn't necessarily mean that samurai warriors ignored school.
                    On the contrary, samurai warriors, priests, and aristocrats in feudal Japan were all highly literate
                    and well educated. Some traditional Japanese samurai warriors even had their own personal library
                    of books, known as a buke bunko, that they would read and study.</p>

                <h1 align="left">3.They Were Given Random Names</h1>
                <p>A samurai warrior's name wasn't random. In feudal Japan, samurai warriors were named by combining their
                    father's or grandfather's name with a new name. This allowed samurai warriors to carry on their ancestral lineage.</p>

                <h1 align="right">4.Only Men Were Samurai Warriors</h1>
                <p>While most samurai warriors in feudal Japan were men, women weren't prohibited from joining this elite class of warriors.
                    Women samurai warriors have been known to fight alongside their men counterparts. Additionally, they were tasked with
                    protecting their homes from invaders during times of war.</p>

                <h1 align="left">5.They Only Engaged in Military Combat</h1>
                <p>Finally, some people believe that samurai warriors in feudal Japan only engaged in military combat. Not surprisingly,
                    this was the primary duty for many samurai warriors. Others, however, had different duties like maintaining civil order
                    and performing other daily affairs.</p>
